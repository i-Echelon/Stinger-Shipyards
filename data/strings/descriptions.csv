sex_lilim,SHIP,"The Lilim is a dedicated missile destroyer designed to provide a mobile platform for missile fire support. Being much more sluggish compared to other hulls of its size, the Lilim-class serves a great escort role as the hammer against the anvil. Despite the ship's great performance as a support platform, it is rarely used in the post-Collapse sector due to the ship's overbearing maintenance costs.

The profound Lilim-class was built by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation as a response to the deployment of the Gryphon-class series of ships designed by Altair Exotech. Noticing the Gryphon's effectiveness as a support ship in fleet engagements, it was decided that a new series of ships specializing on missile support were to be designed and constructed. Being the result of this program, the Lilim-class has almost no armaments besides its four missile slots. This allows the ship to serve a dedicated missile support role; from providing long range support behind the frontlines to escorting capital ships and delivering finishing blows on enemy hulls.",,,
sex_lilith,SHIP,"The Lilith is a dedicated missile cruiser designed to provide a mobile platform for heavy missile fire support. The hull-integrated missile nanoforge ensures that the ship can replenish missile armaments. Being much more bulky compared to other hulls of its size, the Lilith-class serves a great escort role as the hammer against the anvil. Despite the ship's great performance as a support platform, it is rarely used in the post-Collapse sector due to the ship's overbearing maintenance costs.

The mighty Lilith-class was built by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation as a response to the deployment of the Gryphon-class series of ships designed by Altair Exotech. Noticing the Gryphon's effectiveness as a support ship in fleet engagements, it was decided that a new series of ships specializing on missile support were to be designed and constructed. Being the result of this program, the Lilith-class has almost no other armaments besides the many missile mounts the ship. Of particular interest is the addition of a Paladin Point Defense built into the hull. This allows the ship to serve a dedicated missile support role; from providing long range support behind the frontlines to escorting capital ships and delivering finishing blows on enemy hulls, while also providing point defense support from missiles and fighters launched from enemy forces.",,,
sex_brynhildr,SHIP,"The Brynhildr, an ancient missile cruiser, embodies resilience through its sturdy construction, foregoing modern shielding technology. Instead, the Brynhildr relies on an integrated Damper Field, utilizing archaic design principles meticulously adapted to contemporary standards. This remarkable adaptation enables the Brynhildr to withstand what would otherwise be devastating damage during intense combat encounters.

Wrapped in an enigmatic shroud of mystery, the Brynhildr's origins remain largely obscure. It was retired from active service alongside the early iterations of the formidable Onslaught battleship. Evolving doctrines within the Domain Navy, coupled with the ship's relatively high maintenance costs at the time, rendered it impractical for continued fleet utilization. However, in the tumultuous post-collapse sector, the Brynhildr-class vessels have been brought back to service and have proven their mettle as formidable missile support platforms.",,,"construction, an integrated missile autoforge, and no modern shields. Instead, the Brynhildr is equipped with an integrated Damper Field of archaic design but tuned to modern standards. This allows the Brynhildr to allocate 100% of flux buildup to weapon systems, leaving defense to its heavy armor enhanced by the obscure physics of resonant field-dampening."
sex_tartarus,SHIP,"A favorite of pirates and private armies due to the missile support it can provide along with its non-demanding support profile, the ancient Tartarus-class frigates pack a respectable amount of missile firepower. The ship's suprising agility allows a wise commander to shift missile support to wherever it is needed.

This design is old enough to be contemporary with early models of the Onslaught battleship, though unlike that illustrious pillar of the Domain Navy, the Ko Combine m225 ""Tartarus"" was never intended to be a frontline combat ship. It was originally designed as a cheap and affordable ship to assist in mining operations. After the collapse of the Gate network however these ships were fitted with missile armaments and became the favourite of independent captains for the ship's non-demanding support profile.",,,
sex_adramelech,SHIP,"The Adramelech is a rare, experimental cruiser designed for mine-laying operations. Significant amount of hull space is dedicated to assembly lines for the production of large, bulky phase mines that the ship can deploy during combat. This allows the Adramelech to support allied ships with strategic mine deployments even during extended deployments. The ship also has a small nanoforge dedicated to the production of smaller proximity mines which can be launched from the two Proximity Charge Cannons built into the hull.

While the Adramelech boasts remarkable utility in strategic mine deployment, its substantial upkeep costs and relatively niche role limits its widespread deployment within fleets. However, on occasion, discerning captains may encounter this vessel acting as a formidable heavy escort for Tri-Tachyon flagships or, in more exceptional circumstances, under the command of enterprising mercenaries.",,,
sex_mine_strike,SHIP_SYSTEM,Teleports a heavy strike mine to the target area. The mine will slowly track nearby enemy ships and explode a few seconds after its proximity trigger is activated.,Offensive,,
sex_whiskeypete,SHIP,"The Whiskey Pete is a drone carrier designed to lead civilian mining operations. Featuring no modular fighter bays, the ship instead includes an array of drones designed to assist in cracking open asteroids which have been modified in cycles post-Collapse to assist during combat situations as well. Nonetheless, the Whiskey Pete is not a combat ship and works bests as a support ship behind the frontlines.

The Ko Combine M650-R was a remarkable ship even before the Collapse of the gate network for the sheer number of auxiliary drones it could support for the ship's size. In the dangerous Post-collapse sector many modification packages have been assembled by various survivalist and pirate groups with the most popular being the one developed by Whiskey ""Milkers"" Pete, which consists of specifications to up-armour the ship for combat, supercharge factory-spec systems and replace the outdated drones with more modern SEx Co. designs. The Whiskey Pete modification is revered by many privateers for the revolutionary design of its huge titanium nano-alloy frontal fuel containers with distinctive voluminous figure. While some may appreciate the subtle architecture, in recent history, the heavily shielded tanks offered the means of the reliable smuggling of coveted Eventide spirits, earning the venerable ship its name.",,,
sex_hammer_mining_drone,SHIP,"Simple drones fitted with hammer-class torpedoes, designed to assist in mining operations. Fragile and underarmed, these drones rely on support from escort fighter screens to deliver their payload.",,,
sex_escort_mining_drone,SHIP,"Simple mining drones with aftermarket combat modifications that make them somewhat effective in combat, yet still lacking the punch of proper fighter wings.",,,
sex_quadgiga,WEAPON,"Quad launcher system capable of launching a devastating torpedo barrage. the Quadruple Giga-class torpedo platform offers a devastating four-launch burst of Giga-class torpedoes, but is held back by its hefty logistical profile and a disappointing damage potential during extended deployments due to a limited magazine size.",,,
sex_perigee,SHIP,"The Perigee-class vessel is an effective mix of advanced scientific and military technologies, perfect for long-range exploration of hostile space. The ship features relatively accommodating weapon mounts, advanced weapons systems and a great logistical profile. Although flexible, the Perigee usually struggles with dedicated combat vessels of similar size, relegating the ship to mostly support roles.

The ship features a large sensor dome at the front end of the ship which is useful in survey operations and combat encounters alike. Perigee captains are used to operating in small fleets and tend to be an independent, self-reliant lot. The ship can hold its own in one-on-one engagements by smart use of its powerful shield emitter and strong engines. However, its armor rating makes it seem somewhat fragile on paper, and thus it is rarely part of big fleet actions. The high construction costs of the hull typically mean that only affluent tech mining consortiums can afford an Perigee-class vessel that is fully outfitted for an aggressive exploratory role.",,,
sex_stronghold,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Stronghold drone is one of the heaviest drones deployed in drone units. Lacking most regular armament the Stronghold instead includes many missile-type weapon mounts to provide unmatched firepower in the few drone units which were expected to face the heaviest of resistance. Not being much more than a support platform meant that the Stronghold drones were anticipated to regularly be disabled in combat, so the heavy drone was designed with highly modular components which allowed badly damaged hulls to be rapidly cannibalized to repair lightly damaged hulls up to combat capacity without the need for shipyard facilities. The Stronghold is rarely seen among drone units due to the simple fact that they were deployed much sparsely compared to other drones.",,,
sex_spicagiga,WEAPON,A torpedo launcher designed to fire Giga-class torpedoes in two-round bursts. Makes up for its limited damage potentional with unmatched strike damage.,,,
sex_mephisto,WEAPON,A short-range defensive weapon system that fires at an astonishing rate of over a thousand rounds per minute. The rounds from the Mephisto are only effective against projectiles and fighter craft as any ship-grade armor can easily deflect the rounds,,,
sex_starliner_original,SHIP,"A passenger liner from a more civilized age, the Mbaye-Gogol 440 ""Starliner"" was built to travel between the systems of the Domain in speed and comfort. The Starliner features private first-class cabins, two classes of food service, a zero-G theatre, and even a small landing/launch bay for exclusive use by executive-class passengers. (Being a civilian ship there are, of course, no facilities for fighter repair and rearmament)'.

The Starliner is equipped with a forward shield to ensure passenger safety and protect the hull from routine abrasion. Unlike the common refit seen in the Sector today, this ancient relic has few weapon mounts and an even more fragile base hull. The stronger, pristine armor plating of the ship does very little to help protect its fragile hull.",,,
sex_mora_original,SHIP,"An unmodified original civilian model before the Mora-class hulls were refitted into carriers, demilitarized variants of the Mora-class are still used by salvage crews and prospectors alike. This class of ship was commissioned during the same period of carrier-centric Domain naval doctrine as the ubiquitous Talon fighter. Armoured to withstand the fury of battle alongside the Onslaught, the Mora was nonetheless decommissioned en masse as doctrine shifted to favour heavier guns and capital ships flanked by line-cruisers. Demilitarized hulls were sold and converted into mobile industrial platforms for use on the frontiers of the Domain. While lacking the formidable weaponry and advanced combat systems of its militarized counterpart, this variant of the Mora-class remains a versatile and reliable vessel sought after by salvage crews and resource prospectors operating in the far reaches of space.

The rugged and eminently adaptable Mora is a common sight in long-range surveying, mining, construction, drone handling, and use as mobile drydocks. Some hulls were even half-buried on alien worlds and used as armoured power-stations and workshops to form the core of new settlements. After the Collapse, many Mora hulls were re-militarized almost suspiciously rapidly by factions that did not possess dedicated fleet carriers although the demilitarized hulls are still used as auxiliaries in the Sector to this day.",,,
sex_hainuwele,SHIP,"Perhaps the magnum opus design of the Orion Shipyards, the Hainuwele-class is able to project vast amounts of firepower through its numerous fighter craft squadrons. When not protected by its fighter wings it never travels alone but instead is at the head of space-borne carrier fleets. These task forces are a rarity, as the power they hold is usually required to subjugate entire planets or blockade enormous areas of space.

The Hainuwele series of hulls were designed by the Orion Shipyards, the corporation behind such designs as the Conquest-class series of ships as well as many former traditional Armada ships. Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that the mobility required for advanced tactics would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. The result was a formidable battlecarrier, much faster than many capital ships even today, though lacking the heavy armor plating that most capital ships of the time came equipped with.",,,
sex_drover_original,SHIP,"While most ship-captains are familiar with the modern Drover design of ship - and its troubled development - many captains aren't aware of the earlier designs. The first generation of Drover series of hulls were deployed very briefly in backwater worlds to bolster carrier capacity before they were recalled to be decommissioned as elements in the navy who followed the old Capital-school sent the Drover design back to committee, citing insufficient firepower for the ship weight class to meet standard guidelines. While most of these ships were indeed decommissioned and scrapped, it would seem that not all of them were, as this hull is a prime example of the first generation design of the Drover hull. While the ship was - and is still is - arguably out-of-date even in current Sector standards, its pre-Collapse origin means that the technology within the hull is highly sought-after and is likely to fetch a great price if sold.",,,
sex_embattlement,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Embattlement drone is a pure support platform and not much else. Lacking most regular armament the Embattlement instead is equipped with a single, large missile-type weapon mount to provide effective firepower support in drone units which were expected to face a fair bit of resistance. Two heavy plates of ablative armor mounted at the front of the unit allow the drone to take a fair bit of punishment when faced head-on, though the ship's poor mobility leave it vulnerable to flanking.",,,
sex_melpomene,SHIP,"The Melpomene is a rare, experimental hull developed by the Tri-Tachyon corporation. The ship is infamous for its hull-integrated prototype ""Temporal Shell"" system and the it's so-called ability to violate the laws of physics. Only a limited run of prototypes has been produced.

Gross causality violating technology was banned by the Domain, and this ban is now upheld by Hegemony doctrine - with Luddic support. Nonetheless, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation funded further research into the field of 'time manipulation' through black projects and clandestine research programs hidden from Domain authorities. The Melpomene's uniquely hull-integrated prototype ""Temporal Shell"" system, first tested with the Scarab series of hulls, was quickly scaled up and supposedly deployed into two bigger cruiser-sized hulls. While the other, more developed prototype is lost to history after the collapse, the Melpomene-class series of hulls remain in service, and are considered one of the most advanced designs currently available in the Sector.",,,
sex_furtive,SHIP,"The Furtive is complete overhaul of the Eagle-class series of combat cruisers. Decommisioned hulls are demilitarized and many systems are removed to make space for additional cargo bays. The conversion process is an involved and complex affair that requires a vast amount of work on the part of a skilled shipwright. The result is a freighter with impressive agility for it's size, but little in terms of offensive capabilities.

The originator of the desing is said to be the owner of an independent salvage firm who was frustrated by the limitations of their existing ships. Many of the freighter designs commonly found throughout the Sector are quite utilitarian in nature. Big, bulky, and slow, they have a tendency to get stuck in bad places. In particular, their low top speed means that they are exceptionally vulnerable when being pursued. As such, the Furtive is a highly maneuverable ship designed specifically to elude pursuit. It is fast enough to escape most pursuers, but also big enough to hold considerable quantities of cargo.",,,
sex_spectre,SHIP,"A stealth tug which audaciously employs phase technology to support covert fleet operations, the Spectre is not cheap or efficient. Raised up from a dusty set of databanks hidden in an unnamed rock orbiting a nondescript star for a hundred cycles after the First AI War, the Spectre schematics provided an immense boon to the logistics of Tri-Tachyon raiders during the Second AI War. These fleets were infamously named 'sensor ghosts' as their extensive use of phase technology made them almost invisible to most fleet sensors.

""We were a few days out from port, and this whole fleet of the Tachie sensor ghosts, just appeared out of nowhere.... Just went past us in six hours like it was nothing. Not even our escort frigates could burn that fast."" - Commander Kane Gleise, recovered logs from ISS Black Star",,,
sex_proxy_cannon,WEAPON,"An ejector cannon integrated into the ship, designed to launch proximity mines at high velocities. Integrated ordnance assembly facilities on-board the hulls it is mounted in feed the magazines with a constant supply of ammunition for extended deployments.",,,
sex_starliner_mk2,SHIP,"This is a Starliner hull modified by the militant faithful of the Luddic Path into a fearsome battle cruiser. The passenger decks are collapsed and re-welded to greatly thicken the effective armour of the hull and the ship's former flare launchers have been bastardized into launching canisters of fused flak. Several platforms, ripped from other ships, have been attached to the hull to provide more space for mounting weapons aimed at those who serve Moloch that they may perhaps find absolution in blessed oblivion.

The base Starliner hull, with its many passenger decks, offered vast amounts of space for the militant engineers of the Luddic Path and their approach to ship design can be seen in its full glory with this modification. The forward-facing shield generator has been entirely removed, and in its place, a damper field generator has been added to keep the structure stable when under fire. The old thrusters of the ship, used mostly for maneuvering purposes, have been completely replaced with a capital-grade engine that has been haphazardly modified to operate well beyond its intended range of operation.",,,
sex_nephilim,SHIP,"A support-oriented high-tech carrier, the Nephilim is the result of the line of thought that 'sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense'. Significant hull space is dedicated to the ship's 'fortress shield' system which allows the Nephilim to effectively stand against ships of higher tonnage. What the ship lacks in raw firepower it makes up for with its survivability and flexibility.",,,
sex_mule2,SHIP,"This is a Mule hull modified by the militant faithful of the Luddic Path into a fearsome combat destroyer. The cargo decks are collapsed and re-welded to thicken the effective armour of the hull while additional turrets have been planted along the hull. A single large weapon mount has been crudely mounted at the front, aimed at those who serve Moloch that they may perhaps find absolution in blessed oblivion.

The Mule-class is a tough nut to crack, which makes its designation as a combat freighter apt. Pirates will often bypass even a lone Mule and go off in search of easier prey.",,,
sex_myriad,SHIP,"The Myriad, a relic from the explosive expansion of the Domain, represents a bygone era of unrelenting dominance. As an imposing behemoth, it stood as the ultimate symbol of power, instilling fear and asserting authority over all spacefaring civilizations deemed worthy of conquest. However, the relentless march of military progress rendered its hull obsolete. Its armor design proved incompatible with early shield generators, its crew requirements were staggering, and its targeting systems lacked sophistication. Consequently, the great Domain forges swiftly replaced it with modernized alternatives, such as the Legion-class.

Ages passed, until the Knights of Ludd chanced upon an untainted museum archive on a desolate world. Faced with a moral quandary, a council of inquisitors fiercely debated the line dividing sin from virtue, and the corrupting influence of technology versus righteous craftsmanship. Against the odds, a senior knight-inquisitor with an unusually open mind meticulously studied the archive's contents and successfully convinced the council to indefinitely postpone the order of destruction.

Thus, the vessel was christened the ""Myriad,"" paying homage to the countless fighter decks housed within this war cathedral. No conventional navy would dare deploy such a monstrous ship, but the Church and its Knights could rely on an abundance of devoted volunteer-militants to man the vast array of fighters and rudimentary targeting stations.

Trauma teams aboard this specialized vessel work tirelessly to treat and stabilize wounded crew members, ensuring their swift recovery and minimizing the loss of valuable personnel during combat engagements and operational disasters.

With the ever-escalating costs of ship maintenance and the demands of warfare, most authorities find it difficult to justify the financial burden of sustaining a hospital ship. Only the faithful volunteers of the Luddic Church, and the dutiful captains of the Hegemony, operate hospital ships in these troubled times. Its presence symbolizes a rare dedication to humanity in the face of war, transcending political boundaries and affiliations. A reminder that even in the darkest of times, humanity's capacity for empathy endures.",,,
sex_rescue,SHIP,Nimble and delicate auxiliary vessel designed to assist in search and rescue operations. Equipped with minimal armaments to contain disasters and cut up bulkheads during extended operations.,,,
sex_hammerhead2,SHIP,"This variant of the renowned Hammerhead hull has undergone significant modifications at the skilled hands of the faithful engineers of the Luddic Path. The most striking alteration to the Hammerhead Mk.II is complete removal of modern shield systems in favor of an Orion Drive affixed to the ship's stern. This radical propulsion system typically reserved for light warships grants the Hammerhead Mk.II unparalleled speed and agility on the battlefield. The ship's newfound ability to quickly reposition itself has proven instrumental in both evading enemy fire and launching swift, devastating attacks.

What sets this particular refit apart is the suspiciously well-made execution of these modifications. The faithful of the Luddic Path, known for their staunch opposition to advanced technology, have typically shown limited expertise in harnessing the full potential of such systems. It leaves observers wondering how a faction so deeply rooted in religious tradition and disdain for high-tech advancements could produce such a refined vessel. It sparks speculation about secret alliances, hidden support from other factions, or even clandestine deals made in the shadows of the sector.",,,
sex_eradicator2,SHIP,"The Eradicator Mk.II is an extraordinary marvel of Luddic Path engineering. Modern shielding systems have been completely ripped out in favor of an archaic damper field, and the now-empty hull space is filled with additional weapon mountings as well as shoddily-integrated flux conduits. These ill-advised modifications would in any other context be considered insane, but it is these very modifications that give the Eradicator Mk.II the sheer firepower to stand up against more conventional ships. The ceremonial symbols etched upon the ship's hull serve as a constant reminder of its faithful purpose.

The additional weapon mounts inadequately integrated into the hull amplify its destructive potential, enabling the Eradicator Mk.II to unleash devastating salvos upon those who serve Moloch that they may perhaps find absolution in blessed oblivion.",,,
sex_condor2,SHIP,"A product of radical modifications made to the original Condor hull, this formidable battlecarrier strikes fear into the hearts of its enemies with its distinctive blend of raw power and reckless ingenuity. Weapon mounts have been haphazardly integrated into the hull and the ship's fighter assembly systems have been recklessly overclocked and pushed beyond their designed limits to churn out a relentless swarm of fighters at an incredible speed. These additions lend the ship a rough, patchwork appearance, but don't let its unconventional aesthetics fool you, for within its chaotic exterior lies a deadly arsenal that can rain destruction upon those who serve Moloch that they may perhaps find absolution in blessed oblivion.",,,

sex_co,FACTION,"The Stinger Explosives Corporation is a loose-knit and often violent organization of miners, salvage specialists and ex-mercenary gunsels. The collapse of the Gate network left a vacuum in the market for processed metals used in the construction of everything from starships to orbital installments. The corporation was quick to claim the Junk Belt, a region of the Marmara system filled with derelict starships, the remains of orbital factories, and the wrecks of ancient spacecraft. The corporation was able to operate there relatively unmolested by bigger, wealthier entities thanks to the various wars and skirmishes that broke out after the collapse. Hostile takeovers were carried out with explosives and jury-rigged mining vessels, and rival operations were destroyed with underhanded sabotage and ambushes in hyperspace.

The end of the Second AI War saw the arrival of an official peacekeeping force from the Hegemony. The company was quick to switch gears and establish itself as a legitimate salvage and mining firm, but the criminal past of many of its members and its remote location mean the company is looked at with suspicion by its competitors. The sale of illegal munitions, narcotics, and weapons is rumored to still be a significant source of income for the corporation, although the company maintains that it is now fully aboveboard.

The backing of the Hegemony legitimized the company's claim to its territory, making it very difficult to oust the firm by force without sparking a war.

Conventional fleet dynamics dictate that a number of smaller warships be kept in a fleet for a number of reasons. Their utility, be it for escort or logistic duties, is vital for the survival of the larger capital ships. However, smaller hulls simply do not have the armor, tonnage, and armament potential to match their larger counterparts and are more likely to be destroyed in combat. No logistics chain can support an infinite amount of smaller hulls and the loss of smaller hulls is thus not sustainable. The Broodmother design, in its purest sense, attempts to address this issue by simply building entire frigates during the course of combat. Being autonomous drones with no need for human crew, they can be sacrificed at a rate which no conventional navy can keep up. Any losses can be quickly replaced as long as the autofabs are fed with the raw material needed for such rapid production.
