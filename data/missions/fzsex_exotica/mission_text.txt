A true believer is never sure of himself. Only after he has acted with conviction, and that conviction has been validated by others, can he sleep soundly at night. That is why true believers can never see themselves as they truly are; to see one's own weakness, one's own failings, is to turn away from Ludd, to give oneself over to doubt, to the sin of pride. Informants, black-market contacts, all were willing to speak and to reveal their own darkness if only it meant their lives could continue without fear, without the shadow of Moloch's eye hanging over them. One such informant left a hint; a rumor about the movements of convoys seemingly disappearing into the black void.

An ambush on one of these unusual convoys reveals information about a secret rendezvous of the Tri-Tachyon corporation. Off the books, off the grid, hidden among the ruins of the sector. Reports of technological abomination. Ships that refuse reality and bend the laws of physics. The existence of TTS Exotica must be denied. It is time for action. The true believers need to move quickly.

The Path strikes.
